## Development Guidelines

### Code Style & Standards
- Use TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- Follow ESLint rules and Prettier formatting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Implement proper error handling and logging

### Component Development
- Follow Atomic Design principles
- Use composition over inheritance
- Implement proper prop interfaces with TypeScript
- Use React.memo for performance optimization
- Follow shadcn/ui patterns for consistency

### State Management
- Use local state (useState) for component-specific data
- Implement custom hooks for shared logic
- Use Context API for global state (theme, auth)
- Avoid prop drilling with proper state lifting

### API Development
- Follow RESTful conventions
- Implement proper HTTP status codes
- Use Zod for input validation
